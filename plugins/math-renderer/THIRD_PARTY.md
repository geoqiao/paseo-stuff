# Third-party provenance

Plugin-authored code is MIT. Dependencies retain their own licenses; npm integrity
hashes and exact resolved transitive versions are in package-lock.json.

| Dependency | Version / npm gitHead | License |

`prepare:markdown` transpiles the pinned markdown-it UMD distribution to ES5
syntax and wraps it as ESM for Hermes loading. Upstream comments/licenses are
preserved; only the stale source-map reference is removed. The generated parser
is ignored and rebuilt from the locked npm artifact, not maintained as a fork.

The resvg WASM is used unmodified. Its corresponding source is available at
https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/tree/9ca058462ac529120c8cc84ddcd6fef644cc5406
(including its Rust dependency lockfile and wasm build sources). The generated
base64 TypeScript is ignored and rebuilt from the npm artifact; it is not a
fork or a modification of MPL-covered sources. Retain this source-availability
notice and the license when distributing a compiled plugin.

MathJax's bundled TeX SVG glyph paths are used; no system font scan or external
font service. This prototype pins v3's synchronous, self-contained font path;
MathJax v4 migration remains a maintenance task before a general release.
Speech/XML accessibility modules are not imported into the runtime; the npm
dependency tree still overrides @xmldom/xmldom to fixed patch 0.9.12.

The parser was written for this prototype. PR #2562 informed delimiter/streaming
test cases, but its application renderer and tokenizer were not copied:
https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/2562

Five unmodified Paseo source fixtures are Apache-2.0, pinned to v0.8.0 commit
b8e24677e12b226c7c38c1c3a40649daa9f1152f. See tests/fixtures/paseo-0.8/README.md
and its LICENSE. They are test-only and excluded from production bundles.
