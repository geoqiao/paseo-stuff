# Paseo Stuff

Independent community plugins for [Paseo](https://paseo.sh), maintained in one repository.
Each plugin has its own manifest, version, npm lockfile, tests and license. There is no
shared runtime or root-hoisted dependency tree.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Directory | Status / important limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Math Renderer | [plugins/math-renderer](plugins/math-renderer) | Paseo 0.9 or later; block LaTeX after reply completion. Use native-reply mode for chat Find. Inline math and native mobile acceptance are not complete. |
| Readable Agent Activity | [plugins/agent-activity](plugins/agent-activity) | Tool cards need Full detail; before using Summary, choose "Activity: use native tool rows" in each client's Command Center. |
| DeepSeek Harness | [plugins/deepseek-harness](plugins/deepseek-harness) | Provider adapter; requires a separately installed, compatible official DSH executable and credentials. |
| MaKa | [plugins/maka](plugins/maka) | **Unmaintained since 2026-09-24.** Experimental provider for the official MaKa ACP CLI, last tested with MaKa dev39; newer MaKa releases are not tracked. Its `<0.10.0` range makes Paseo 0.10 reject it. |
| Paseo Pet | [plugins/paseo-pet](plugins/paseo-pet) | **Paused (unmaintained) since 2026-09-28.** Experimental sidebar companion for user-supplied Codex pet packs; native mobile acceptance is not complete. No character assets included. |

Activity **0.1.0-beta.9**, DeepSeek Harness **0.1.0-beta.10** and Math Renderer
**0.1.0-beta.4** declare minimum-only Paseo requirements and are checked against the
Paseo **0.9.2** and **0.10.0-beta.1** SDKs and host pipeline source. A minimum is not
a promise about later releases; each plugin's verification record lists what was
tested. MaKa **0.1.0-beta.4** (final, unmaintained) stays limited to Paseo 0.9.
Pet remains on its existing 0.8 support range (0.1.1, paused; not migrated to 0.9).
Use each plugin's pinned installation command and read its verification limits.

Read each plugin's README before installing. Plugins are trusted, unsandboxed code;
their permissions and operational requirements differ.

## Install a plugin from this repository

For Math Renderer, run against the intended daemon after reviewing
the plugin and enabling plugins in Paseo:

```sh
paseo plugin add geoqiao/paseo-stuff:plugins/math-renderer --ref math-renderer-v0.1.0-beta.4 --host <host:port>
```

The `:plugins/<directory>` suffix selects one plugin, not the whole repository.
Do not enable two installations of the same timeline renderer or provider.

This is the new development and release home for Readable Agent Activity and
DeepSeek Harness as well. Their old repositories and immutable release tags remain
available for existing installations. The existing Cafe entries keep their IDs;
the registry migration in PR #97 has merged and points to this repository.

Existing Git installations do **not** switch repositories automatically. See the
[migration notes](MIGRATION.md) before changing an installed source. Each plugin
README records its current immutable install tag and verification limits.

## Development

Use npm from the plugin directory, not the repository root:

```sh
cd plugins/math-renderer
npm ci --ignore-scripts --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund
npm run prepare:markdown --if-present
npm run prepare:wasm --if-present
npm run check
```

CI independently installs and checks all five plugins on Node.js 22 and 24.
Use the public Paseo SDK. Typecheck before reloading the exact installed ID on an
explicit host; do not restart the daemon or enable an intentionally disabled plugin.
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repository development rules.

## Versions and Cafe

Each plugin maintains its own `package.json.version`. Git tags use
`<plugin-id>-v<version>` so releases remain independent in the monorepo.

Publishing a GitHub release for an npm-distributed plugin (currently DeepSeek
Harness) runs [`publish-npm.yml`](.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml), which
checks the tag against `package.json`, runs the plugin checks and publishes
with [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). No
npm token or OTP is involved, and npm attaches provenance. To publish an
existing tag again, run the workflow manually with that tag; versions already
on npm are skipped. A new npm package must first trust the workflow once with
`npm trust github <package> --file publish-npm.yml --repo geoqiao/paseo-stuff --allow-publish`
and be added to the workflow's plugin list.

A [Paseo Cafe](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe) entry can point to a subdirectory:

```json
{
  "repo": "geoqiao/paseo-stuff",
  "path": "plugins/math-renderer",
  "categories": ["productivity"],
  "submittedBy": "geoqiao"
}
```

The entry filename must match that plugin's `paseo-plugin.json.id`. Each listing is
submitted separately; a pull request is not a claim that Cafe has accepted the plugin.

The current Cafe scope includes these four plugins, all sourced from this repository:

| Catalog ID | Plugin directory | Cafe PR / status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `readable-agent-activity` | `plugins/agent-activity` | [Merged migration #97](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/pull/97) |
| `deepseek-harness` | `plugins/deepseek-harness` | [Merged migration #97](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/pull/97) |
| `math-renderer` | `plugins/math-renderer` | [Merged entry #98](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/pull/98) |
| `maka` | `plugins/maka` | [Merged entry #120](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/pull/120) |

Paseo Pet remains managed here but is not submitted to Cafe. All four entries have
merged. The MaKa entry stays listed with an unmaintained caveat. Version/README updates appear after Cafe's next scan and deployment;
updated curator caveats require a separate Cafe review.

## Licenses and publication scope

Repository-authored material is MIT unless otherwise noted. Each plugin retains its
own LICENSE and dependency/upstream notices; bundled test fixtures retain upstream licenses.
Readable Agent Activity derives from Matt Cowger's MIT plugin; see its
[provenance](plugins/agent-activity/UPSTREAM.md).

Local experiments, internal workspace notes, generated bundles, dependency directories,
host configuration, credentials and personal conversation captures are not published.
Plugin tests and screenshots use synthetic content.
